# How do I contact them?

{% hint style="info" %}
**You must have Discord to contact the Staff team whenever, otherwise you will only be able to private message them when they are online on tristansmp.com**
{% endhint %}

## In-Game

You can simply just press `t` (the default Minecraft key-bind to open chat) and ask, if you want to talk privately firstly you need to find a Staff Member by holding `tab` and looking for a username that starts with the prefix `[STAFF]` and then typing `/msg <username> hey this guy is griefing me` for example please make sure to remove `<username>` with an actual staff members username like `/msg nailayaa hi` for example
