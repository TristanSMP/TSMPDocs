# Staff Commands

{% hint style="info" %}
**Fyi: these commands can only be run by our **[team.md](team.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### **Application Procedure ( All Staff )**

{% hint style="info" %}
New application people will create a new ticket and ask if they can have it reviewed.

Your job is to find it in `#`applications and review it then if you like it use these commands in order
{% endhint %}

```
?acc
?da @pingthem
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to run these commands in the ticket, also if the application is bad don't say they are denied, just ask them to expand and if they are still "sus" or not giving a good enough answer tell them to redo the application and run the command
{% endhint %}

```
$close
```

### **Discord Commands** ( Only for Discord Staff)

`$close` - closes the ticket (use this when it was important like a punishment appeal)

`$delete` - Deletes the ticket (use this one when the ticket is not important as an application review)

`?mute @pinguser 10m spamming` - Mutes the pinged person for set time and reason

\#logs and #staff-logs - logs legit everything (very useful)
